# Watson Assistant API

This API provides a service to Watson Assistantâ„¢ provided by IBM, in node js.

Wa combines machine learning, natural language understanding, and an integrated dialog editor to create conversation flows between your apps and your users.

The Assistant v2 API provides runtime methods your client application can use to send user input to an assistant and receive a response.

You can see more @ IBM's [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/assistant-v2?code=node). 

## My Watson Assistant

I made this Assistant to provide answers about some medicines. I use **Watson Assistant**, **Watson Discovery** and **NeuralSeek** available on IBM Cloud.

**Watson Assistant**: To build a virtual agent, powered by AI

**Watson Discovery**: To search and answer questions about business documents using custom NLP and Large Language Models from IBM Research.

**NeuralSeek**: Connects existing knowledge database (in my case was Discovery) and instantly generates natural-language answers to real customer questions.

The integration of Watson Discovery and NeuralSeek is in Watson Assistant, i have [another project](https://github.com/miucciaknows/Medicine-Assistant) using the same features and Assistant showing how to integrate to your website. 

In this case i was using the same project to made an API connection.
